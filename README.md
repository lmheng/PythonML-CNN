# PythonML-CNN
Unstructured Machine Learning using CNN

This is a team project we have been assigned with to perform CNN on a provided dataset on Fruits.

The code I have uploaded here were mostly done by me, but credit also goes to fellow teammate Eswaran for coming up with the code for
working on the code for image augmentation as well as the graph to measure the accuracy rate vs loss for each epoch. You may find his
profile right here: https://github.com/EswaranRajagopalan

Project Specifications:

• A Fruits dataset will be provided to you, and it consists of images
of (1) apples, (2) oranges, (3) bananas and (4) a mix of fruits
• Implement a CNN to recognize the 4 classes. Use the images in
the “train” folder to train your image classifier
• Test the accuracy of your image classifier using images from the
“test” folder
• Document what you did to increase the accuracy of your image
classifier (e.g. image augmentation)
• Use Matplotlib to plot the loss and accuracy of your training
(pick any of your better runs)
• Specify the best/final accuracy of your image classifier on the
test data
